# Uk-Smoking-Prevalence-Analysis
## 🎯 1. Project Objective
To analyze smoking habits across demographic and socio-economic groups in the UK. This prohect helps identify key patterns and potential public health intervention areas based on age, gender, income, education, ethnicity, and marital status.

## 📂 2. Dataset Overview
The dataset captures the percentage of smoking population distributed across:
•	Demographics: Gender, Age Category, Ethnicity, Nationality
•	Socio-Economic Factors: Income Class, Education Level
•	Lifestyle Attributes: Marital Status, Weekly vs Weekend Smoking Patterns

## 🛠 3. Tools Used
•	Power BI: Dashboard creation and data visualization
•	Excel: Data cleaning and transformation
•	Power Query: For data shaping

## 🧹 4. Data Preparation
•	Standardized categorical labels (e.g., gender, marital status)
•	Grouped income and education levels
•	Calculated average consumption on weekdays vs weekends
•	Filter panels built for interactivity by ethnicity, age group, and nationality

## 🗃️ 5. Data Model Summary
A flat structure was likely used due to the demographic-focused nature of the data. Each record represents a group percentage segmented by multiple attributes like gender, income, education, etc.
