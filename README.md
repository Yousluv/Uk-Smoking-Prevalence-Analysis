# Uk-Smoking-Prevalence-Analysis
## üéØ 1. Project Objective
To analyze smoking habits across demographic and socio-economic groups in the UK. This study helps identify key patterns and potential public health intervention areas based on age, gender, income, education, ethnicity, and marital status.

## üìÇ 2. Dataset Overview
The dataset captures the percentage of smoking population distributed across:
‚Ä¢	Demographics: Gender, Age Category, Ethnicity, Nationality
‚Ä¢	Socio-Economic Factors: Income Class, Education Level
‚Ä¢	Lifestyle Attributes: Marital Status, Weekly vs Weekend Smoking Patterns

## üõ† 3. Tools Used
‚Ä¢	Power BI: Dashboard creation and data visualization
‚Ä¢	Excel: Data cleaning and transformation
‚Ä¢	Power Query: For data shaping

## üßπ 4. Data Preparation
‚Ä¢	Standardized categorical labels (e.g., gender, marital status)
‚Ä¢	Grouped income and education levels
‚Ä¢	Calculated average consumption on weekdays vs weekends
‚Ä¢	Filter panels built for interactivity by ethnicity, age group, and nationality

## üóÉÔ∏è 5. Data Model Summary
A flat structure was likely used due to the demographic-focused nature of the data. Each record represents a group percentage segmented by multiple attributes like gender, income, education, etc.

## üìä 6. Visualization

‚Ä¢	Weekday vs Weekend Smoking
o	Average consumption:
ÔÇß	Weekends: 4.09
ÔÇß	Weekdays: 3.42

‚Ä¢	Smoking by Income Class
o	Higher prevalence among lower-income groups:
ÔÇß	10,400 to 15,600: ~31% (both genders)
ÔÇß	Under 2,600: Females (22.52%), Males (50.00%)
o	Sharp decline in higher income classes (e.g., Above 36,400: Female: 7.69%, Male: 18.42%)
‚Ä¢	Smoking by Ethnicity
o	Highest among Mixed ethnicity (35.71%)
o	Followed by White (25%) and Black (23.53%)
o	Lowest among Chinese (18.52%) and Asian (19.51%)
‚Ä¢	Smoking by Gender
o	Male smokers (51.51%) slightly exceed females (48.49%)
‚Ä¢	Smoking by Highest Qualification
o	Highest among those with GCSE/CSE (38.78%) and GCSE/O Level (34.86%)
o	Decreases with higher education:
ÔÇß	Degree holders: only 15.08%

## üëÅÔ∏è 7. Observations
‚Ä¢	Education and Smoking Inversely Correlated: Lower qualifications significantly associate with higher smoking rates.
‚Ä¢	Young Adults Most Affected: Age group 18‚Äì30 appears most vulnerable.
‚Ä¢	High Weekend Consumption: Weekends see elevated smoking levels, suggesting lifestyle or social factors.
‚Ä¢	Income Impact: Smoking rates decline as income increases. Particularly high rates in the lowest two brackets.
‚Ä¢	Ethnic Variation: Mixed ethnic groups and White individuals show higher prevalence.
‚Ä¢	Marital Status Insight: Being single or divorced correlates with higher smoking behavior.
‚Ä¢	Gender Gap Narrowing: Though slightly higher among males, smoking rates are relatively balanced across genders.

## ‚úÖ 8. Recommendations
1.	Targeted Campaigns for Young Adults
o	Anti-smoking campaigns should focus on young adults and teenagers through social media, colleges, and youth programs.
2.	Education-Based Interventions
o	Incorporate smoking awareness into school curricula, especially in areas with low education attainment.
3.	Income-Level Awareness Programs
o	Provide free cessation support in low-income communities, including financial incentives or subsidies.
4.	Weekend-specific Messaging
o	Run campaigns over weekends, emphasizing health risks linked with binge smoking patterns.
5.	Support for High-Risk Marital Groups
o	Partner with mental health services to address stress-related smoking in divorced or single populations.
6.	Community & Ethnicity-Centric Engagement
o	Culturally tailored interventions for Mixed and White communities with higher prevalence rates.
7.	Gender-Neutral Public Health Messaging
o	Address both male and female audiences, reflecting the minimal gap in smoking behavior.
